<h3> about me </h3>

  <img src="images/certification-intro.png" alt"">

<p> I’ve always been very athletic. You name it, I’ve played it; volleyball, basketball, and a lot of soccer. Unfortunately, like many other athletes, I never fully appreciated the value of proper training practices and stretching, which led to injury and the end of my athletic career. While I felt very strong and powerful, my overall flexibility was extremely limited, and I only ever dreamed of touching my toes. This experience led me to educate myself on the intricacies of the human body and how to have a more well-rounded training practice. I now aspire to educate others in the same manner, and to help them develop a full and healthy understanding of their fitness practices.</p>

    I had Ashleigh as a personal trainer for over 2 years at Movati. Excellent trainer who could work within my limits and still get me to reach my goals. I recommend her services as she can tailor a program to your specific needs. <br><br> Barbara Lee, Ottawa, Ontario

My wife and I have been training with Ashleigh for just over a year now. We are in the best shape we have ever been in! It's great because we can do partner training and bring our daughter along which really helps fit excercise into our weekly schedule. <br><br> Robert Cobb, Ottawa, Ontario

I started seeing Ashleigh for her Fascial Stretch Therapy about 4 months ago after I experienced a soccer injury. She has really helped me with my range of motion, to allow me to start playing again. <br><br> Linda Murphy, Ottawa, Ontario

I started seeing Ashleigh for strength building, and general education that I lacked. I have never been a gym person, but from seeing her and feeling so strong after our sessions, it's really changed my views on the way I look at training. She also really helped me with alignment and proper technique! <br><br> Michelle Laforest, Ottawa, Ontario
